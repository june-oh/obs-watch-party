# README and Markdown File Standards

This document outlines the standards for creating and maintaining README and other Markdown (`.md`) files in this project.

## General Guidelines for all `.md` Files:

1.  **Dual Language Support**: All documentation should be written primarily in English. A Korean translation should be provided as a secondary option. For instance, have `README.md` (English) and `README.ko.md` (Korean).
2.  **Target Audience**: Content should be written with the general user in mind.
3.  **Developer Section**: Information specifically for developers should be grouped into a "For Developers" section, placed at the very end of the document.

## Specific Guidelines for `README.md`:

1.  **Table of Contents (TOC)**: The main `README.md` file must include a Table of Contents for easy navigation.
2.  **Back to Top Link**: Include a "Back to top" link at the end of sections or at the bottom of the `README.md` to allow users to quickly return to the beginning of the document.

## Project Goal:

Keep in mind that the ultimate goal is to release this project as an open-source project on GitHub. Well-structured and clear documentation is crucial for this.
